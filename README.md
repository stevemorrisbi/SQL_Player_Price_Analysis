# Player Price Analysis -

### Utilising Football player price data from Transfermarkt.com - I have developed a SQL query to compare the segmentations of player prices between any team. 
### The query counts the total number of players that fall into each segment, ranging from low price to very high price.
### The query can be used as a tool for overall squad value comparisons.

### (A commented SQL script can be found in this repository)
